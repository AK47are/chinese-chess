## Description

【English | [简体中文](./README.md)】

This repository stores the course project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course: Visualized Chinese Chess. The graphical interface is developed using Qt C++ and written in Qt Creator.

Usage: Open the project in Qt Creator by clicking on the corresponding CMakeLists.txt file.

For future learners who want to study, you can look at the commit records step by step to see how I implemented it. You can also read my course design report (39 pages in total, Simplified Chinese only) stored in the docs folder, left for the use of future learners. If this helps you, just give me a small star :)

The code still has bugs and lacks certain features (e.g., no move recording/replay system, and the AI opponent is very basic). If interested, feel free to submit pull requests or issues.

## Features

- Extensive code comments and documentation (course design report).
- Simple code structure based on object-oriented design.
- Multiple optimizations for clarity-focused implementation.
- Supports standalone mode, networked multiplayer, and AI opponent.
- Implements undo moves, move replay, etc. (see commit submission records).
- Custom piece creation via otherpieces.cpp.
- Customizable chessboard display size, position, and component layout.
